Title of the Project: Exploration of Cardiovascular Health Data - Data Analysis and Manipulation

Description:

The exploration project of cardiovascular health data focuses on the in-depth analysis of a simulated dataset containing medical information, with particular attention to blood pressure, smoking habits, and overall cardiovascular health of the participants. During the analysis process, various modifications and manipulations were made to the data in order to obtain a more complete and detailed understanding of the patterns and trends present.

Dataset Modifications:

Division of the Blood Pressure Column: The blood pressure column has been divided into two separate columns, "BloodPressureMin" and "BloodPressureMax," to facilitate analysis and make the data more interpretable.

Division by Gender: The data has been divided based on the gender of the participants, distinguishing between females and males.

Project Objectives:

Analyze and interpret data related to smoking habits among participants, calculating the total number of smokers, the percentage of smokers compared to the total participants, and identifying gender differences among smokers.

Investigate the correlation between smoking habits and cardiovascular health, including the percentage of smokers who have had at least one heart attack, both among males and females.

Evaluate the importance of physical exercise on cardiovascular health, calculating the percentage of individuals over 35 years old who exercise at least one hour per week and the percentage of individuals who, in addition to exercising, have had at least one heart attack.

Analyze the blood pressure of participants, including the percentage of people with blood pressure over 120 and the percentage of people with blood pressure over 120 who have also had at least one heart attack.

Examine specific cardiovascular health habits of smokers, including the percentage of smokers with blood pressure over 120 and smokers over 50 years old who exercise at least one hour per week.

Further explore the correlation between smoking, blood pressure, age, and history of heart attacks, including the percentage of smokers with blood pressure over 120, under 50 years old, who exercise at least two hours per week and have had at least one heart attack.

Conclusions:

The exploration project of cardiovascular health data has provided an in-depth insight into the cardiovascular health habits of simulated participants. The analyses conducted have highlighted several significant correlations between smoking habits, physical exercise, blood pressure, and history of heart attacks, providing a basis for further research and interventions in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
